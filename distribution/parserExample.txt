# This is a comment
This is also a comment
# But using the '#' sign is just safer.
# This way, we can use new commands later which are interpreted as comment BY DEFAULT.
# That means, we don't need to manage a list of 'comment characters' anymore.

# This is an IF-block:
?if
# The ?if currently tries to read an EXPRESSION.
# EXPRESSIONs work in Polish notation.
# Note that that within the EXPRESSION part, all comments must start with '#'

# Or be the empty line.
not
# NOT reads ONE argument.
XOr
# We're case-insensitive when it comes to expressions.
true
or
false

# unknown EXPRESSION-IDs are interpreted as "false".
# If you look closely, you'll see that we reached the end of the EXPRESSION

# That works just as expected.
# IMPORTANT: You should always end the path with a '|' except you really know what you're doing.

# # This code snippet:
# |examples|missingPipe
# Foo.txt
# Bar.txt
# # Would download "Foo.txt" and "Bar.txt" into "|examples|missingPipeFoo.txt"
# # and "|examples|missingPipeBar.txt"
# # => Might be useful

?else
# You can stack ?ifs into one another btw.
# Just too lazy to demonstrate.
# Note that with ?else and ?endif the "path"-prefix of the parser snaps back by one level.
